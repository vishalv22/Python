## 4.1 String Datatype
String is a DataType in Pyhton.<br>
String is a sequence of characters enclosed in quotes, we can primarily write a string in these three ways:
```bash
name = "Vishal"     # 1. Single quoted String
a = 'Hello'         # 2. Double quoted String
b = '''World'''     # 3. Tripple quoted String
```


### String Slicing:
String slicing lets us “cut” and “pick” parts of a string the way we want.
<br><br>

→ The index in a String (left to right) starts from '0' , means The first character is at position 0, second at 1, and so on. (0, 1, 2, ...)
<br><br>

→ Negative indexing (right to left) : here -1 refers to the last character, -2 to the second last, and so on. (..., -3, -2, -1)
