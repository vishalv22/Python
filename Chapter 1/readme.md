## Basics

- #### The ```print``` function is used to print output :
```bash
print("Hii My name is Vishal")
# Output: Hii My name is Vishal
```


- #### Comments
Python ignores comments, and so will not execute code in there. It is used to explain code when basic code itself isn't clear.<br>
**Single Line Comments**
```bash
# This is a Single Line Comment in Python
```

**Inline Comment**
```bash
print("Hello")   # This line prints Hello 
```

**Multiline Comments**: Comments spanning multiple lines have """ or ''' on either end.
```bash
"""
This type of comment spans multiple lines.
These are mostly used for documentation of functions, classes and modules.
"""
```
